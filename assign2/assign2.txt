	display the image size, average intensity, maximum and minimum intensity (20 points)
	save the image into a file named "output.jpg" using function imwrite (10 points)
2.Submit only the source code of your program.
3.Within the program, use comment lines to describe how to execute the program to demonstrate the successful completion of the above actions.
	Name your program as follows: "Assignment1_" followed by your first initial and last name then the extension name, e.g., for student John Franklin, name the file as Assignment1_JFranklin.m. Note: fail to follow the naming convention will result in a penalty of 10 points.
