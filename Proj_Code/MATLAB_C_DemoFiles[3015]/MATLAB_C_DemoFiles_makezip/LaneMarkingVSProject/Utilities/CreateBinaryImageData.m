%% Create Binary Image Data
% 
% This functoin reads in an image and creates a 
% raw binary file of that image.  We then read
% the raw image back in and display it.
%
% The purpose of this file was to create a
% portable image representation that could be
% used in the lane markings demo that did not
% require any additional libraries.
