%% Lane Marking Identification
% One component of future luxury automobile safety
% systems is warning drivers that they are drifting
% between lanes.  To do this, it is first necessary
% to identify where the lanes are.  In this example,
% we will look at identifying the lanes from a image
% of a road.

%% Setup
clear

%% Read image 
% Let's first read in this JPEG image from the current
% directory by double-clicking.
street1 = imread('street1.jpg');

%% Display image
% First of all, in MATLAB 7, we can now plot any workspace
% variables just by selecting it and choosing a plot type.
% Here we see a frame from a camera looking at a road scene
% including the lanes we need to identify.

figure;
gray(256);
imshow(street1);

%% Scale image
% This image is a little too dark so let's brighten it. However,
% you will notice that it contains uint8 data. Now for the first
% time we can perform arithmetic on integers and singles. As well
% as resulting in up to 8x less memory used than if the data was
% expanded to doubles, it can result in up to 8x faster executions. 
scaled=street1*1.2; 
image(scaled);

%% Thresholding image
% Next, we will create a binary image by
% comparing it to a threshold value. 
level=125;
binary = scaled>level; 
imshow(binary);

%% Remove the noise
% We will now use an Image Processing Toolbox function to
% remove all small groups of pixels.
binary = bwareaopen(binary,100);
imshow(binary)
hold on

%% Find the boundaries of objects
%... then another function to find the boundaries of all
% the objects in the image. Then we display those in green.
[B,L] = bwboundaries(binary,'noholes');

h = zeros(1, length(B));
% Plot boundaries
for K=1:length(B)
    boundary = B{K};
	h(K)=plot(boundary(:,2), boundary(:,1), 'g', 'LineWidth', 2);
end
% Extract statistics
stats = regionprops(L,'MajorAxisLength','MinorAxisLength'); 

%% Find lanes and delete non-lane objects
% We can detect the lanes by testing each object and
% deleting ones that are not lane-shaped i.e. long and
% thin. 
lanes=findlanes(B,h,stats);
hold off;

%% Place lanes on original image
% Finally we will display the original image and plot
% the lanes on it
imshow(street1);
hold on

for K = 1:length(lanes) 
    plot(lanes{K}(:,2), lanes{K}(:,1), 'g', 'LineWidth', 2) 
end
hold off
