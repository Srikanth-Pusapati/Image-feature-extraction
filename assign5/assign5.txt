Load image 'Balloon.tif' and convert it into a grayscale image, denoted with 'img1'
Apply Fourier transform to img1 using MATLAB buildin function fft (and fftshift) and display the amplitude and phase matrices using abs and angle functions (20 points)
Create a Gaussian lowpass filter and apply it to the Fourier coefficients of img1. (10 points)
Perform inverse Fourier transform using ifft to recover the filtered image and display it to screen (10 points)
Create a Gaussian highpass filter and apply it to the Fourier coefficients of img1. Using inverse Fourier transform to recover the filtered image and display it to screen (15 points)
Decompose the original img1 with wavelet transform. Display the wavelet coefficients as an image. Note: you will need to rescale the values to be in the range of [0 255]; otherwise, the image appears black. (20 points)
Reconstruct the edge map from the detail subbands. Hint: set the approximation subband to zero. Save the reconstructed edge map into an image. (15 points)
Compute the energy, entropy, and homogeneity features for both processed edge maps and calculated the differences. (10 points)
